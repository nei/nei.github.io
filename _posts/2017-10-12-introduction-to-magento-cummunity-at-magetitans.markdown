So, it is Sunday 2 PM in the cold Manchester and I just wake up thinking about Magento after the intensive MageTitans 2017.

[MageTitans](http://uk.magetitans.com/) is a Magento Conference for Developers in the UK which aims to engage the Community. And I have to say that my experience was amazing and I really think they had hit the target.

Side note: besides the event being in the UK there were people all over the world including some fellows citizen of me from Brazil.

On Friday, we had the Dev Exchange and Panel which was in the cool office of [Spece48](https://www.space48.com/) where I had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world. We had an interesting presentation from Tom Erskine where he introduced the NEW Magento Functional Test Framework and there was an interesting exercise where we could sit on tables which had defined topics and exchange ideas about it. 

It ended with a Panel with three respected names from the community, including the Director of Operations of Magento. All that with good pizza and beers just to warm up to the next day :) All good stuff!

Saturday, the day was really intensive and full of content ranging from Test Automation, Security, UI, Development and much more. It was exactly 14 really good presentations and loads of coffee between.

I am new on the Magento world but I keep thinking about how vibrant this community is and also excited about its direction. MageTitans was like a boost of motivation and inspiration which will definitely help on my way through the Magento's learning curve.

It gives you the feeling that you are a part of something bigger and you are not suffering alone :)

Summing up, there is a vibrant community out there which are contributing and learning together and I want to be part of it.
