Some days ago I was looking at some papers from about 6 years ago which I’ve written down my goals in both professional and personal life and this experience was astonishing. Have you tried this?

When you look at it, you remember the feelings you had at that moment and how difficult was that to be achieved. But the best part is when you achieve that and you see that wasn’t a big deal, everything went fine and now your goals are even more challenging.

On of my personal goal was to travel to the US. I’ve never thought about travelling to Europe, it was all about America since I was studying English at that time. It turns out that on the following year I went to a 16-days backpacking in Europe which I visited Paris, Amsterdam, Bruges and London. After that, I’ve travelled twice to the USA and also twice to Europe.

I remember how difficult it was to me to pay for such an expensive trip, even for a super budget travel. It was like saving money for 2 years. Nowadays I’ve travelled over 12 countries and also lived in England for 1 year.

I’ve now decided to start blogging about personal stuff to have more feelings like this in the years to come and keep some records of my thoughts.
