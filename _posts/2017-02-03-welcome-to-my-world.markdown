I've decided to blog about personal stuff and things that I am interested in. Maybe some content will be useful to someone. It probably not but I'm going to do anyway at least I can try improve my English on the way :)

Just dumping some stuff from my head to markdown files.

Topics you may find here: PHP, Magento, Symfony, NodeJS, DevOPS stuff, Startup, Finance, Productivity, Lifestyle, Living Abroad, Working abroad, Culture, Books or anything else really.

That's all lets see how often I will be able.
